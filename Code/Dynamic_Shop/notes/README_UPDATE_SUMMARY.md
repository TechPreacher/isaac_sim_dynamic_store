# README Update Summary ‚úÖ

## Changes Made to README.md:

### ‚úÖ Product Inventory (Updated)
- **Product count**: Updated from 19 to 25 products throughout document
- **Category count**: Updated from 6 to 8 categories 
- **Added new categories**:
  - ‚òï **Mugs** (3 items) - Physics enabled
    - `_25_mug`, `_25_mug_01`, `_25_mug_02`
  - üßÄ **Mac-n-Cheese Boxes** (3 items) - Physics enabled  
    - `mac_n_cheese_centered`, `mac_n_cheese_centered_01`, `mac_n_cheese_centered_02`

### ‚úÖ Physics Information (Enhanced)
- **Physics count**: Updated from "10 physics, 9 static" to "16 physics, 9 static"
- **Enhanced collision detection**: Added information about ConvexHull and mesh collision
- **Fall-through prevention**: Documented collision setup to prevent products falling through surfaces
- **Configuration options**: Added section explaining physics toggle settings

### ‚úÖ New Features Documented
- **üé≤ Randomization**: Added info about 3 random products getting randomized rotations each run
- **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration section**: New section explaining:
  - `ENABLE_PHYSICS_FOR_ALL` setting
  - `FORCE_COLLISION_FOR_PHYSICS` setting  
  - Physics troubleshooting guide

### ‚úÖ Updated Scene Hierarchy
- Added **Mugs/** and **Mac_n_Cheese/** categories to hierarchy diagram
- Added item counts and physics status for each category

### ‚úÖ Updated Asset Sources
- **YCB Dataset**: 22 products from Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object and Model Set
- **Isaac Props**: 3 Mac-n-Cheese products from Isaac Sim food assets
- Added both asset URL sources with proper formatting

### ‚úÖ Updated Project Overview
- Added randomization as feature #6: "Randomizes 3 products with random rotations for variety each run"
- Updated performance metrics for 25 products
- Updated validation info to reflect 25 products

### ‚úÖ Version History (Updated)
- **v1.2**: Added 6 new products, enhanced physics with collision detection, added configuration options
- **v1.1**: Added randomization feature  
- **v1.0**: Initial release (now noted as 19 products for historical accuracy)

## Verification Results:
- ‚úÖ All 8 categories properly documented
- ‚úÖ Correct product counts throughout (25 total)
- ‚úÖ Physics breakdown accurate (16 physics + 9 static = 25)
- ‚úÖ Randomization feature documented
- ‚úÖ Configuration options explained
- ‚úÖ Asset sources properly attributed
- ‚úÖ Version history up to date

**The README.md is now fully up to date with all current features and accurate product information! üìö‚ú®**
