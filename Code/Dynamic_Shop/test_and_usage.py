Test Runner and Usage Instructions for Dynamic Shop Placer

This script provides instructions and test functionality for the dynamic shop placer.

# Usage Instructions:
"""
HOW TO USE THE DYNAMIC SHOP PLACER IN ISAAC SIM:

1. SETUP:
   - Make sure IsaacSim is installed and running
   - Ensure the USD files are in the ./assets/ directory:
     * Shop Minimal Empty.usda (empty shop environment)
     * Shop Minimal.usda (populated shop - for reference)

2. RUNNING THE SCRIPT:
   - Open IsaacSim
   - Load the dynamic_shop_placer.py script
   - Execute the script in IsaacSim's Script Editor or Python console
   
   OR
   
   - Run from command line: python dynamic_shop_placer.py (if IsaacSim Python environment is configured)

3. WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES:
   - Loads the empty shop USD file (Shop Minimal Empty.usda)
   - Creates the product hierarchy (Items_Lower/Items_Upper with categories)
   - Places 18 products with exact transforms from the original shop:
     * 3 Mustard Bottles (lower shelf)
     * 3 Spam Cans (lower shelf, with physics)
     * 4 Tuna Cans (lower shelf, with physics)
     * 3 Bleach Cleanser bottles (lower shelf, with physics + velocities)
     * 3 Cracker Boxes (upper shelf)
     * 3 Tomato Soup Cans (upper shelf)

4. PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND LOCATIONS:
   - Lower Shelf (/World/Shelf/Items_Lower/):
     * MustardBottles/ - 3 mustard bottles
     * Spam/ - 3 spam cans with physics
     * TunaCans/ - 4 tuna cans with physics
     * Cleaner/ - 3 bleach bottles with physics and motion
   
   - Upper Shelf (/World/Shelf/Items_Upper/):
     * Crackers/ - 3 cracker boxes
     * TomatoCans/ - 3 tomato soup cans

5. PHYSICS PROPERTIES:
   - Some products have rigid body physics enabled
   - Physics-enabled products have collision detection
   - Some products have initial velocities and angular velocities
   - Physics approximation set to "convexHull" for realistic behavior

6. ASSET SOURCES:
   - All products use YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset assets
   - Assets are loaded from Omniverse content servers
   - URLs point to official Isaac Sim asset library

7. COORDINATE SYSTEM:
   - Uses original USD coordinate system
   - Products placed at exact positions from populated shop
   - Shelf coordinate system: X=-25 (shelf front), Y=44-48 (shelf length), Z=0.8-2.1 (shelf height)

8. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - If assets don't load, check internet connection (external URLs)
   - If shop doesn't load, verify ./assets/Shop Minimal Empty.usda exists
   - If products appear in wrong locations, check coordinate system alignment
   - If physics doesn't work, ensure IsaacSim physics is enabled

9. CUSTOMIZATION:
   - Modify PRODUCT_DATA dictionary to add/remove/move products
   - Change asset URLs to use different products
   - Adjust physics properties per product
   - Modify hierarchy structure in create_product_hierarchy()

10. EXPECTED OUTPUT:
    - Console messages showing loading progress
    - Empty shop environment loaded as base
    - Products appearing at shelf locations with proper orientations
    - Physics-enabled products responding to gravity and collisions
