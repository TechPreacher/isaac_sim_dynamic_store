# Helper Scripts for Dynamic Shop Placer

This directory contains various utility scripts for testing, verification, and analysis of the Dynamic Shop Placer project.

## Available Scripts

### Core Testing Scripts

- **`test_product_data.py`** - Test JSON product data loading and structure validation
- **`test_and_usage.py`** - Complete test suite with usage instructions and comprehensive verification
- **`verify_data.py`** - Comprehensive data verification including position validation and asset URL checks

### Analysis Scripts

- **`analyze_physics.py`** - Analyze physics settings of all products and categorize by type
- **`count_products.py`** - Count and list all products with category breakdown

### Functionality Testing

- **`test_randomization.py`** - Test rotation randomization functionality with both sample and real data
- **`verify_readme.py`** - Verify README documentation contains all expected information

### Utility Scripts

- **`run_all.py`** - Run all helper scripts in sequence for complete project verification
- **`__init__.py`** - Package initialization file with documentation

## How to Use

### From Project Root Directory:
```bash
# Run individual scripts
python helpers/test_product_data.py
python helpers/analyze_physics.py
python helpers/test_and_usage.py

# Run all scripts at once
python helpers/run_all.py
```

### From Helpers Directory:
```bash
cd helpers

# Run individual scripts
python test_product_data.py
python analyze_physics.py
python test_and_usage.py

# Run all scripts at once
python run_all.py
```

## Script Dependencies

All scripts are designed to work independently and only require:
- Python 3.6+
- Standard library modules (json, pathlib, random, math, etc.)
- Access to the parent directory containing `assets/product_data.json`

**Note**: These helper scripts do NOT require Isaac Sim and can be run in any Python environment.

## What Each Script Tests

### test_product_data.py
- Loads and validates JSON product data structure
- Checks for required fields (asset, translate, scale, physics_enabled)
- Verifies data types and array lengths
- Categorizes products by type
- Reports product counts by category

### analyze_physics.py
- Analyzes physics settings for all products
- Lists physics-enabled vs static products
- Categorizes products by type and physics setting
- Provides detailed breakdown by category

### count_products.py  
- Simple product count verification
- Lists all products with IDs
- Identifies newly added products (mugs, mac-n-cheese)

### test_randomization.py
- Tests rotation randomization logic
- Works with both sample data and real product data
- Demonstrates both Euler angle and quaternion rotation handling

### verify_data.py
- Comprehensive data structure validation
- Position validation (checks if products are within shop bounds)
- Asset URL validation (verifies URL format and structure)
- Categorization by shelf level (upper/lower)
- Asset type distribution analysis

### verify_readme.py
- Checks README documentation for key information
- Verifies mention of product counts, categories, physics
- Validates that all product categories are documented

### test_and_usage.py
- Complete test suite combining multiple verification types
- File structure checks (verifies required files exist)
- Product data integrity testing
- Detailed product summary with positions and physics status
- Usage instructions and troubleshooting guide

### run_all.py
- Executes all other helper scripts in sequence
- Provides comprehensive project status overview
- Useful for complete project validation before deployment

## Expected Output

All scripts provide clear success/failure indicators:
- ‚úÖ indicates successful tests/checks
- ‚ùå indicates failures or missing data
- üìä indicates summary information
- üîç indicates detailed analysis

## Integration with Main Project

These helper scripts are designed to work with the JSON-based product data system. They automatically:
- Load data from `../assets/product_data.json`
- Handle relative path resolution from the helpers directory
- Provide validation for the main `dynamic_shop_placer.py` script

The scripts serve as both development tools and quality assurance checks to ensure the product data is correctly formatted and the main placement script will work as expected in Isaac Sim.
